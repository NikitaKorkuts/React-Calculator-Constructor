# React-Calculator-Constructor
This is a calculator, where you can move its components as it will be convenient for you to use it. I used drag and drop mouse events to make it possible to drag calculator components. The calculator has 4 basic operations and has the ability to work with decimal numbers. The calculator works just like windows calculator. The calculated value is rounded to 15 decimal places, there is also processing of the division error by 0 and checking the calculated value for a safe limit.
